I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.pitt.edu/) at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). I obtained my Master's degree from the [Department of Statistics at University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) in April 2020, and I got my Bachelor's degree from the [School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) in July 2018.

My research interests include dynamic treatment regimes, complex clinical trials, causal inference, and survival analysis.
